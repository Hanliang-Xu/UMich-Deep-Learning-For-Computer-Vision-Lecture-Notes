**1 Introduction to Deep Learning for Computer Vision**

Computer Vision: artificial systems that process, perceive, and reason about visual data
Learning: artificial systems that learn from data and experience
Deep learning: hierarchical learning algorithms with many "layers"

Brief history of computer vision and deep learning
	-History of Computer Vision
		Hubel and Wiesel, 1959
			Oriented edges
			Hierarchical representation
		Larry Roberts, 1963
			Original picture - differentiated picture - feature points selected
		David Marr, 1970s
			Input image - edge image, 2 1/2-D sketch, 3D model
		Recognition via parts, 1970s
		Recognition via edge detection, 1980s
		Recognition via grouping, 1990s
		Recognitino via matching, 2000s, SIFT, David Lowe, 1999
		Face detection, Viola and Jones, 2001
		PASCAL visual object challenge
		Image Net Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
		AlexNet: Deep learning goes mainstream
	History of Deep Learning
		Perceptron - linear classifier
		Minsky and Papert, 1969
		Neocognitron: Fukushima, 1980
		Backprop: Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, 1986
		Convolutional Networks: LeCun et al, 1998
		2000s: "Deep Learning" - train neural networks that were deeper and deeper
	2012 to present: Deep Learning Explosion, ConvNets are everywhere
	2012 - algorithms, data, computation
